Kaggle Competition - Yelp Recruiting - Predict Useful Votes
===========================================================

Code for "Yelp Recruiting Competition".  The goal was to predict the useful votes that a review posted on Yelp.com will receive using a predictive model created using supervised machine learning.  This was my first Kaggle contest and I entered late so it was drafted in a rush, only was able to submit one entry ont he last day.  It scored an RMSE of 0.53384 which landed me 135th out of 350 teams.  I was pretty happy wiht that given that it was a last minute submission and my fisrt foray into machine learning.
